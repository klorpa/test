	SELECTCASE ARG
	CASE 0
		PRINTL They can use the summoning computer 'COMP' to it's fullest, utilizing the different programs available.
		PRINTL Capable users of firearms, they possess the [Gunslinger] talent,
		PRINTL which allows them to use many different guns and special ammunition.
		PRINTL Thanks to their [Successor] talent, they can equip some demonic weapons.
		PRINTL Finally, with their [Item knowhow], they can use consumeable items freely during battle.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORML Overall, %classnames:arg%s are good at supporting their summoned demons and companions,
		PRINTL dealing damage of specific elements with their specialized bullets and using consumeables during combat.
		PRINTL However, their MP is always 0 and they can't learn any skills(with a few exceptions).
		PRINTL
		PRINTW They are the baseline class this game is balanced arround.
	CASE 1
		PRINTL They rely on their 'Persona's, which reside within them but can be drawn out to aid their host.
		PRINTFORML Å¶While most %classnames:arg% in the games are limited to one Persona, in eraMegaten, they can all switch personas.
		PRINTL Å¶However, characters have compatibility with personas of specific aligments
		PRINTL Å¶(they more the aligments differ, the less the stat bonus)
		PRINTFORML %classnames:arg% inhert the elemental resistances of their currently equipped persona and
		PRINTL they also gain stat boosts according to the persona's stats.
		PRINTL Å¶Because resistances are taken from the persona, resistance-changes by equipped items have no effect.
		PRINTFORML In addition, all skills of the Persona, including passive ones, will be available to the %classnames:arg%.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL However, their skill at handling the COMP is limited to useage of fusion-software and a few others,
		PRINTL and they can't use a COMP during combat.
		PRINTL In addition, the process of summoning, assigning and leveling Personas needs the assisstance of a the inhabitants of Velvet Room.
		PRINTFORML They also can't use specialized gun munitions or consumeables during combat like %classnames:0%s.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL They are somewhat harder to use because of their special requirements but can grow quite powerful.
		PRINTW If enough Persona are equipped, they can become very flexible.
	CASE 2
		PRINTL When you select this class, you will have to decide on two sub-classes.
		PRINTFORML The %classnames:arg% will have skills and talents depending on the picked classes available(or learn some at higher levels).
		PRINTL In addition, one talent can be chosen after the class-selection has been finalized.
		PRINTL They are not limited to the skills they learn based on the class selection and have full access to
		PRINTL the skill enhancement, delection and acquisition functions of the 'Enhance Demon' menu.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORML All this makes the %classnames:arg% a very variable and flexible class.
		PRINTL However, unless they aquired the [Summoner] talent at a sufficent lvl,
		PRINTL their useage of the COMP inside and outside of combat is limited.
		PRINTFORML They also can't use specialized gun munitions or consumeables during combat like %classnames:0%s.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORMW Depending on the subclasses picked and skills/talents available, %classnames:arg%s can be harder or easier to use.
	CASE 3
		PRINTL They are people who where caught by the Phantom Society but for some reason,
		PRINTL it was decided they should work for the organisation instead of being sold as slaves.
		PRINTL 
		PRINTL They don't possess any notable skills or talents, can't use the COMP inside or outside of combat
		PRINTL (with the exception of fusion software and some passive software)
		PRINTL and can't use specialized munitions or consumeables during battle.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL Picking this class will make surviving quite a challenge. You'll likely have to rely on good equipment to compensate.
		PRINTW And of course, the other members of the group. Good luck.
	CASE 4
		PRINTL They have been infected by a special virus, which grants them a demonic form they can change into at will.
		PRINTL While transformed, they have access to all the skills(including passive ones) of their demonic form.
		PRINTL Unlike other classes, this class learns most of it's skills via mastering so called Mantras.
		PRINTL Mantras can be unlocked with MAG and assigned in a special submenu of the Enhance Demon menu.
		PRINTL Each mantra needs the character to earn exp to master it, with more mastering exp being gained by using HUNT skills.
		PRINTL Mantras with a higher Åö-rating require more MAG and mastering exp to master.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORML If your starting character is an %classnames:arg%, it will also be proficent at using the COMP both inside and outside of combat.
		PRINTFORML However, most other %classnames:arg%s are incapable of using a COMP.
		PRINTFORML %classnames:arg%s are also well versed in the useage of firearms,
		PRINTL possessing the [Gunslinger] talent and being able to use specialized munitions.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORML By mastering Mantras, %classnames:arg% can learn most skills available in the game.
		PRINTL However, skills will have to be set to be able to use them.
		PRINTL This can be done in the Set skills submenu of the Enhance Demon menu.
		PRINTL In the same menu, there also is the Set stats submenu,
		PRINTL which allows changing the stat-boost/reallocation that is used while in a transformed state.
		PRINTL
		PRINTFORMW This class can be hard to get used to but can get quite powerful with patience.
	CASE 5
		PRINTFORML %classnames:arg%s are similar to %classnames:2%s in many ways.
		PRINTL Like them, they have to decide on two sub-classes to focus on.
		PRINTFORML The first one or basic class, can be any of thoose available to %classnames:2%s.
		PRINTFORML The second or master class, is unique to %classnames:arg%s.
		PRINTL The class choices for this sub-class contain many highly specialized and powerful skills.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL However, this comes at a price. Because of their high focus on their specialisations,
		PRINTFORML they can't use MAG to aquire, enhance or remove skills like %classnames:2%s.
		PRINTFORML %classnames:arg%s have some basic knowlege on using the COMP both inside and outside of combat,
		PRINTFORML but they can't use specialized gun munitions or consumeables during combat like %classnames:0%s.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL Overall, they have access to powerful but specialized skills based on their class selection.
		PRINTFORMW Because the skills they gain can't be changed later, they might be a bit harder to use than %classnames:2%s.
	CASE 6
		PRINTW No information available at this time.
	CASE 7
		PRINTL They can link up with demons, which grants them the ability to transform into the appearance of the linked demon.
		PRINTFORML While transformed, all skills of the demon, including passive ones, are available to the %classnames:arg%.
		PRINTL In addition, a stat bonus will be gained, based on the stats of the linked demon.
		PRINTFORML While %classnames:arg%s have an intial link, they can also link with every demon in the group.
		PRINTL However, the linked demon can't participate in battle when the transformation is active.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL Their skill at handling the COMP is limited to useage of fusion-software and a few others,
		PRINTL and they can't use a COMP during combat.
		PRINTFORML They also can't use specialized gun munitions or consumeables during combat like %classnames:0%s.
		PRINTL
		PRINTW This class can get quite powerfull, depending on the demons available for link-up.
	CASE 8
		PRINTW No information available at this time.
	CASE 9
		PRINTL They are not related in any way to the 'Fool' Arcana of the Persona games.
		PRINTFORML Instead, this is an upgrade of the %classnames:3% class.
		PRINTL It does this by giving you a 500% weakness to every element.
		PRINTL This means you take 5 times the damage from every attack and the enemy gets 1more.
		PRINTFORML And as an extra nice addition: %classnames:arg%s can't equip any items.
		PRINTL
		PRINTL
		PRINTW Are you really sure you want to do this?
