@REQUEST_15
PRINTFORMW Visited St Hermelin High School.
PRINTFORMW Managed to enter easily.
WAIT
PRINTFORMW Somehow, the school's interior does not appear peaceful.
PRINTFORMW In several places, parts of the school seemed to be in a different world, and the teachers and students run around in confusion.
PRINTFORMW In fact, not only the school, but Mikage-Cho is sinking into another world.
PRINTFORMW Went looking to talk with Yukino, but couldn't find her.
PRINTFORMW Caught a person who explained the situation, Yukino gathered a group of persona users to enter the other world, while said world encroached upon the school.
PRINTFORMW As far as you heard, the son of Tadashi Satomi that you seek was taken to the other world.
PRINTFORMW Somehow, %CALLNAME:MASTER% was forced to go.
WAIT
PRINTFORMW The place was wrapped in fog.
PRINTFORMW Though the fog seems harmless, %CALLNAME:MASTER% became strangely sleepy.
PRINTFORMW In the corners of a real classroom, students and teachers slept unusually comfortably.
PRINTFORMW While enduring the sleepiness, carefully examined the corners and turned around.
PRINTFORMW Somehow, the sleeping people are hard to wake.

	PRINTFORMW After wandering a while, you heard the sound of fighting.
	PRINTFORMW You follow the sound.
	PRINTFORMW There, 3 three female persona users defeated a demon.
	PRINTFORMW Yukino was at the lead.
	IF イベントフラグ:20:0 != 0
		PRINTFORMW Ayase was there too.
		PRINTFORMW The last was an unknown elegant girl, who had a persona.
	ELSE
		PRINTFORMW Eri was there too.
		PRINTFORMW The last was an unknown freckled girl, who had a persona.
	ENDIF
	PRINTFORMW 「You...I didn't think you would possibly help.」
	PRINTFORMW As Yukino smiled, you said you wanted to deal with the other-worldly incident for campus safety.
	PRINTFORMW However, the 3 seemed uneasy anout your magic.
	PRINTFORMW When %CALLNAME:MASTER% explained future intentions, Yukino frowned and spoke.
	PRINTFORMW 「You are investigating. I should have slept comfortably in a room somewhere.」
	PRINTFORMW 「...Sorry, may I ask something after this?　We're on a time limit.」
	PRINTFORMW 「What could I say instead, you just leave after the investigation.」
	PRINTFORMW 「I do not think it is a good idea to only have one person escape.」
	PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER% hasn't found the boy yet.
	PRINTFORMW ...the person who knew what was going on earlier.
	PRINTFORMW After parting from Yukino, continued searching.　In a few minutes...
	PRINTFORMW 「Umm...Is it you?　Who damaged my dreamworld」
	PRINTFORMW A student of Hermelin called out to you...
	PRINTFORMW She doesn't seem human.　Perhaps, she is the source of the drowsiness...
	PRINTFORMW 「...please just give in...because I'm having a happy dream...」
	PRINTFORMW 「...it is nicer in this dream than in the hot, painful reality...」
	PRINTFORMW You are currently free, but she's trying to cloud your thoughts.
	PRINTFORMW There is no right or wrong if you interfere.
