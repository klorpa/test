PRINTFORML At the appointed time in %CALLNAME:MASTER%'s office.
PRINTFORML The teacher from Seven Sisters High School came.
PRINTFORMW The woman looked at the demon summoner %CALLNAME:MASTER% and tensed but began to talk...
PRINTL 
PRINTFORMW 「Well, are you the Summoner who resolved the incident at Karukozaka?」
PRINTFORMW 「So, I want to depend on you for something...」
PRINTFORMW 「Right now, Seven Sisters High School has not been plunged into an alien world.」
PRINTFORMW 「But recently I had a suspicious feeling that something will happen sometime soon...」
PRINTFORMW 「But because the damage demons can do is unknown,」
PRINTFORMW 「it is hard to contact summoners for jobs.」
PRINTFORMW 「I know it's rude to say it like this but you are still a novice.」
PRINTFORMW 「Because I heard that your are willing to do this kind of work, I came.」
PRINTFORMW 「If a demon seems to appear when I leave at night.」
PRINTFORMW 「I want an expert to check it out.」
PRINTFORMW 「Of course, I will pay you well.」
PRINTFORMW 「Could you please take this job?」
PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER% nodded after some thought.
PRINTFORMW The teacher's face suddenly brightened.
PRINTFORMW 「Ah, that's good.」
PRINTFORMW 「Then, about the investigation...」
PRINTFORMW 「Recently, strange rumors have become popular among the students...」
PRINTFORMW 「There is a risk that this could call a demon.」
PRINTFORMW 「Therefore, I ask you to come to the school to investigate the rumors.」
PRINTFORMW 「There will be a school festival soon, It would probably be best for you to investigate then.」
PRINTFORMW 「Well, in that case, there will be a great many people.」
PRINTFORMW 「Naturally, please avoid the demon as best you can.」
PRINTFORMW 「As for the time, please come after hours in the evening.」
PRINTFORMW Then, made arrangements with the woman...
PRINTFORMW .....
PRINTFORMW ....
PRINTFORMW ...
PRINTFORMW 
PRINTFORMW 「Anyways, that's about it.」
PRINTFORMW 「Ah...well. I rememember on of thoose rumors.」
PRINTFORMW 「It all revolves around someone called JOKER.」
PRINTFORMW 「JOKER grants a wish, or kills someone...」
PRINTFORMW 「Somehow, doesn't that sound like something a demon would do?」
PRINTFORMW 「But, assuming it is a demon, it kills people anyways, but it also grants a wish?」
CALL INPUT_YN("Wish-granters aren't rare(Innocent Sin route)", "It is common to summon demons for murder(Eternal Punishment route)")
IF RESULT == 0
	PRINTFORMW 「I see, instead so it grant a wish in exchange for a soul...」
	PRINTFORMW 「So you mean there could be something to the rumor.」
	PRINTFORMW 「Joker...I hope it isn't too dangerous...」

	PRINTFORMW 「After all, it's like that...」
