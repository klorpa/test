PRINTW -One day-
PRINTW When you received an e-mail from an official of Phantom Society,
PRINTW you went to the front of the designated building。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW Inside the building, there was a well-built man in a guard uniform at the reception desk.
PRINTL 
PRINTW You told the receptionist the password。
PRINTL 
PRINTW After entering the password, the man ushered you behind the desk。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW You were instructed to climb the stairs hidden behind the desk。
PRINTW You saw a automatic machine gun turret and something like a beehive along the way.
PRINTL 
PRINTW As you climbed the stairs, a green light shone on the turret。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW Up there, there was a door guarded by men carrying SPAS12。
PRINTL 
PRINTW After you said the password again, the men nodded。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW When the door opened, you felt something was off。
PRINTW Looking around the room, you saw wards placed around creating a barrier。
PRINTL 
PRINTW A large man with his hair slicked-back hair wearing a haori and hakama was there。
PRINTW Hew was playing with a ball in his palm。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW The man gave a smile as he spoke。
PRINTL 
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Executive A", @"「You came quickly %CALLNAME:MASTER%, I am called A。/　Please call me Mister Antique。/　I am an executive、unlike agents like Mayone and Sid。」"
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「I hear that you often find rare items。/　…And that you often go to other worlds, am I right？」"
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「If the others knew your power…/　As I am meandering、I will get to the point。」"
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「I have a hobby of collecting antiques。/　I want you to collect treasures from other worlds。」"
PRINTL 
PRINTW You glanced sharply at the man。
PRINTL 
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「Fufu、scary。/　There will be no issues、if you cooperate。/　This talk is beneficial for you too。」"
PRINTL 
PRINTW The man continued talking。
PRINTL 
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「I will pay you for worthwhile finds。/　I hope you will enjoy collecting these items。/　I get more tired than most people。」"
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「I ask you keep this secret from the other executives。/　The less people know、the more there is to gain。」"
CALL MESSAGE_WINDOW, "Mister Antique", "「Let us bring happiness to each other/　That is all I have to say。/　I hope you will have treasure when next we meet。」"
PRINTL 
PRINTW As he spoke, he flicked a switch and faded from the place。
PRINTW The higher-ups don't seem to be like ordinary people。
PRINTL 
PRINTW When you went to the desk, there was a memo there。
PRINTW It had contact information for this。
PRINTL 
PRINTW You can contact them if you have treasure。
PRINTL 
PRINTL 
PRINTW You added Mister Antique to you list of suspicious contacts and left。
