PRINTFORML ＞With no foreseen problems、%CALLNAME:MASTER% thinks that the office duties will go smoothly today
PRINTW ＞Suddenly、a young delecate woman appeared
PRINTL 
PRINTL Woman:
PRINTW 「Nice to meet you、I am Chizuru Ishigami。I am also a member of Phantom Society」
PRINTL 「Though、I don't do free-lance work like you do
PRINTW 　I am a personal agent of a certain executive officer of Phantom Society」
PRINTFORMW 「%CALLNAME:MASTER%'s report of the Seven Sisters High School incident was appreciated by the upper echelons」
PRINTL 「I don't know the details、but some things are better left unknown…」
PRINTW 　An enemy of Phantom Society was involved with the incident」
PRINTW 「In Sumaru City、this enemy is the reason that rumors are coming true」
PRINTW 「Well、anyways、it was decides that you would solve the Sumaru City incident」
PRINTL 「Thus、my master sent me here as back up」
PRINTL 　Well、since my master ordered、I will support you」
PRINTW 　After all，underlings have to look out for each other」
PRINTW 「So please accept my best regards from now on」
PRINTL 
PRINTW ＞As she said that、the woman let go of her previous cold expression、smiled、and held out her hand
PRINTFORMW ＞%CALLNAME:MASTER% shakes her hand firmly
PRINTL 
PRINTL Chizuru:
PRINTL 「Then、right away、let's get to work
PRINTL 　For now、our job is to eliminate a group of masked people
PRINTW 　Their purpos is unknown、but they will certainly bring harm to Phantom Society if we let them be」
PRINTL 「Well、about that masked group…、the members are citizens of Sumaru City
PRINTL 　A human who has a wish granted by JOKER is inducted in a ceremony、and becomes a member of the masked group
PRINTW 　And、this ritual will be held at Club Zodiac in Yumezaki-Ku」
PRINTW 「First we should disrupt the ceremony」
PRINTL 「And、because apparently…rumors somehow become reality
PRINTW 　We should make good use of this」
PRINTL 「That's why、if you bring me a rumor、I can work with it and spread it」
PRINTW 　Though if I say that、the rumor has to not be totally baseless、the rumor would be meaningless if it doesn't become popular」
PRINTL 「For now、do we have any today…
PRINTW 　Then、let's do our best」
PRINTL 
PRINTW ＞Chizuru said that and left the office
