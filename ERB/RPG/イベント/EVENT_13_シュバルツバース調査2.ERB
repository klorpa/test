PRINTW 「The investigation of Sector Carina was quite difficult.」
PRINTW 「The Rosetta Manifold that was brought back, was originally created by the original Schwarzwelt Expedition.」
PRINTW 「If that is the case, it might be possible to search for more in sectors where they have been.」
PRINTW 「Well, here is your reward.」
PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER% received ￥20000
MONEY += 20000
PRINTL Messenger：
PRINTW 「By the way, we have your next job.」
PRINTW 「Because the quantum tunnel in Sector Carina can now be used freely for investigation, 」
PRINTW 「we want to explore Sector Bootes, Sector Delphinus and Sector Antlia next.」
PRINTW 「However, it would be inefficient to have one unit explore them one at a time.」
PRINTW 「Therefore, this time, we'll divide our forces into three units.」
PRINTW 「Well, we already have a team for Sector Antlia, so you should go to one of the other two sectors.」
PRINTW 「Which one will you investigate?」
PRINTL
PRINTL [0] Sector Bootes
PRINTL [1] Sector Delphinus

	PRINTW 「and there where also reports of experiments with demons at the same facility.」
	PRINTW 「In any case, the information we could gain there would be quite precious.」
	PRINTW 「The data should be in the laboratory set up at the pavilion of the demon Mithras.」

	PRINTW 「There is a report that the research group contracted a mysterious disease in that sector.」
	PRINTW 「Apparently, using data obtained from Sector Bootes,」
	PRINTW 「some medical experiments where perfomed there.」
	PRINTW 「We don't know where the data on them was stored, but it should be there somewhere.」
	PRINTW 「It's hard to think that this was managed only in Bootes and we don't have all the data collected in Delphinus.」
