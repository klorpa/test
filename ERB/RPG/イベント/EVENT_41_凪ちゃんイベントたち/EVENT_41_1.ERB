PRINTFORMW ＞In the office of %CALLNAME:MASTER%, who has become reputable as a summoner, a girl came to visit.
PRINTFORMW ＞Her hair is black, her face is fair and her blue eyes might mean she's of mixed parentage...
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW 「Nice to meet you, my name is Nagi. Please remember it.」
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW ＞...Somehow, she spoke in a strange voice
PRINTFORMW ＞You introduce yourself to her...and wonder why she wanted you to remember her name.
PRINTFORMW ＞First things first though, %CALLNAME:MASTER% asks the girl why she came here.
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW 「Forgive me, I'll explain my circumstances first...
PRINTFORMW 　I was a student who studied under Geirin Kuzunoha the 17th, who was one of the Four Great Summoners of the Kuzunoha.
PRINTFORMW 　But, my master was...suffering from an illness.
PRINTFORMW 　Since then, I have been trying to teach myself to reach the level of skill my master possessed...
PRINTFORMW 　But I am far behind my master and Raidou Kuzunoha and self-study can only get me so far.」
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW ＞It seems she can't train effectively enough since the death of her teacher.
PRINTFORMW ＞Clearly, she doesn't have much knowledge.
PRINTFORMW ＞However, if she is an aquaintance of Kuzunoha, she should be able to pratice with the Yatagarasu in Katohha village..
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW 「...I am not blood related to my master.
PRINTFORMW 　So I can't overly rely on Kuzunoha Village.
PRINTFORMW 　However, the Yatagarasu get assigned a place for self-training there...
;十文字ワーグナーさんの割と適当な扱いから外部人員への期待値を推測
PRINTFORMW 　Since I'm originally an outsider, I can't expect much support.
PRINTFORMW 　Besides, my own abilities aren't very strong yet, so I am unable to train on a high-level...
PRINTFORMW 　Therefore, I came to ask %CALLNAME:MASTER% for help with my training.
PRINTFORMW 　I heard that %CALLNAME:MASTER% was rapidly growing in skill, 
PRINTFORMW 　so I hope to learn how you grew so quickly.」
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW ＞...Unfortunately, you don't know much about training yourself.
PRINTFORMW ＞You gained all your power from surving the challenges you faced: dungeons, colosseum-battles and requests.
PRINTFORMW ＞From that, your power grew.
PRINTFORMW ＞%CALLNAME:MASTER% calmly conveyed that...
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW 「！　...If it's like that, I want to help with %CALLNAME:MASTER%'s duties.
PRINTFORMW 　If fighting to survive is your method of training...
PRINTFORMW 　Then using the same technique as %CALLNAME:MASTER%, I want to learn.
PRINTFORMW 　Being accompanied by a summoner of the Kuzunoha shouldn't be a problem.
PRINTFORMW 　Of course, I would be grateful every time my skill improved.」
PRINTFORML
PRINTFORMW ＞...Well, what to do?
PRINTFORMW ＞%CALLNAME:MASTER% had the choice: send her away, help with her training, or enslave her.
PRINTFORMW ＞Since her skill isn't too high, you could just send her away.
PRINTFORMW ＞But then you couldn't gain her gratitude.
PRINTFORMW ＞Or you could actually help her, by taking her to dungeons and other challenges.
PRINTFORMW ＞This would gain gratitude from her and the Kuzunoha...
PRINTFORMW ＞But if her skill is low, bringing her along might make things more dangerous.
PRINTFORMW ＞Finally, you could just enslave her.
PRINTFORMW ＞However, that could make the the Kuzunoha and Yatagarasu your enemies.
PRINTFORMW ＞While the Yatagarasu are unlikely to bother with her,
PRINTFORMW ＞her close relationship to Raidou could be cause for concern...
PRINTFORMW ＞%CALLNAME:MASTER% decided to...

PRINTL [0]Accept her request and help with her training
PRINTL [1]Refuse to help her train
PRINTL [2]Pretend to help her train, then enslave her
