		PRINTL Because it could not be opened、should you leave now？ When you began to consider it、the gate suddenly opened。
		PRINTL Standing there was a student with short-hair、and a freckled schoolgirl that you recognized、it was Ayase。
		PRINTL 「What is it？ You should have told me if you were coming here」
		PRINTL You seems to have appeared when Ayase was between classes。
		PRINTL 「If Ayase's benefactor says so、it cannot be helped」
		PRINTL And、the shot-haired girl‥‥introduced herself as Yukino Mayuzumi‥‥and relaxed a bit while muttering。
