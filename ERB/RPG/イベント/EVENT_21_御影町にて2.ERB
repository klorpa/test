	PRINTL You went to explore Mikage-Cho, now that you can enter.
	PRINTL There are no people on the streets, not even dead people, looking like they could run and hide surprisingly well.
	PRINTL There are demons, but none are particularly powerful.
	PRINTFORML There seem to be many places where pockets of space have been sent to a different world, but when they are avoided, %CALLNAME:MASTER% faces no particular danger.
	PRINTL ......
	PRINTL ....
	PRINTW ...
	PRINTL For a while, you were a bit confused, as nothing special seemed to be happening.
	PRINTL If one decides to plunge into an area that was plunged into a different world, you may reach your limit, a risky thing with little meaning.
	PRINTL After walking along the subway for a bit, you suddenly met a girl at the exit.
	PRINTL She was wearing the uniform of St. Hermelin High School of Mikage-Cho.
	PRINTL 「!　Wait...you there, the subway doesn't move.」

		PRINTL 「Unbelievable! To actually bring along demons, I can't believe it!」
		PRINTL The girl's words strangely held no disgust, rather...is that a look of envy?
		PRINTL 「...ahem, excuse me」
	ELSE
		PRINTL 「Going around such a place safely, do you have a means to fight demons?」
	ENDIF
	PRINTL The girl introduced herself as Eriko Kirishima.　She is a persona-user and a student of St. Hermelin High School.
	PRINTL 「I presume, you know a way out of here?　If that is so, could we cooperate?」
	PRINTL She seems to wish to exchange information.
	PRINTL Well, how will you respond?
	CALL INPUT_YN("Accept", "Decline")
	IF RESULT == 0
		PRINTL ...Better to accept, but how do you intend to explain your information?
		PRINTL Opening a hole in the boundary can only be done for a short time, so only a few people can enter and exit.
		PRINTL Taking her out alone, wouldn't help in solving the incident.
		CALL INPUT_YN("Talk at length about the circumstances", "Feed her nonsense")
		IF RESULT == 0
			PRINTFORML While she listened to %CALLNAME:MASTER%, she paid close attention.
			PRINTL 「...You don't seem to be lying. In other words, If we want to go out together, we should try to destroy the barrier instead of looking for an exit.」
			PRINTL 「Thanks! That was very helpful.　As for what I found out, it seems trivial compared to that...」
			PRINTL The girl seemed to have gone searching Mikage-Cho for an exit.
			PRINTFORML %CALLNAME:MASTER% got some information on Mikage-Cho.
			PRINTL 「Then, I'll look around in various places some more. Well, I hope we'll be able to meet again somewhere...」
			PRINTW The girl bowed and left.　Maybe you'll see her again soon.

			CALL INPUT_YN("It doesn't matter if she doubts you", "Catch and enslave her")
			IF RESULT == 0
				PRINTL Even if she suspects you, what could you say?
				PRINTL After all, it is doubtful that this girl could have any useful information.
				PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER% ignored the girl's suspicions and left.

			ELSE
				CALL INCREASE_LD, -16
				PRINTL Even if she doubts your trifling story, the girl is quite good-looking.
				PRINTL In addition, she is a rare persona-user.
				PRINTL There would not be that big a loss if you capture her. And she is useful as a woman.
				PRINTFORML %CALLNAME:MASTER% went up to the girl. Pretending to passby, %CALLNAME:MASTER% smacked her hard.
				PRINTL The girl collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
				PRINTW Eriko Kirishima became a slave.
