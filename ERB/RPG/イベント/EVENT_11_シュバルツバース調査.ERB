PRINTFORMW In %CALLNAME:MASTER%'s office.
PRINTW A messenger from the Phantom Society arrived.
PRINTL
PRINTL Messenger：
PRINTW 「Do you remember the Schwarzwelt that appeared on the South Pole several years ago?」
PRINTW 「Officially, a large blizzard suddenly appeared at the South Pole.」
PRINTW 「Actually, it is a portal to Makai that is famous in our world.」
PRINTL
PRINTW Schwarzwelt...
PRINTW If you are not mistaken, ４ squads of special soldiers and engineers from around the world entered
PRINTW but only a small fraction of １ squad was able to return, or so the story goes...
PRINTL
PRINTL Messenger：
PRINTW 「In the Schwarzwelt, other than this research group, there was １ more.」
PRINTW 「Did you know that the mercenary unit Jack's Squad also entered?」
PRINTL 「Jack's Squad was not a formal research group. Additionally, they were annihilated in a battle with the expedition.」
PRINTW 「It's no wonder that you don't know about them.」
PRINTL 「It was Jack's Squad that made the original route into Schwarzwelt.」
PRINTW 「But now, we have secured a route.」
PRINTFORMW 「Therefore, since %CALLNAME:MASTER% has gotten stronger recently,」
PRINTW 「we want you to investigate the Schwarzwelt.」
PRINTL 「In the Schwarzwelt, there are many materials that aren't of this world.」
PRINTW 「They should fetch a hefty sum.」
PRINTW 「Having money will reduce your troubles and could also raise your reputation within the organization.」
PRINTL
PRINTFORMW When %CALLNAME:MASTER% heard that this could raise reputation within the organization,
PRINTFORMW %HE_SHE(MASTER)% decided to accept the Schwarzwelt Investigation.
PRINTL
PRINTL Messenger：
PRINTW 「Then, I'll give you this software.」
PRINTL 「In the severe environment of the Schwarzwelt, you must wear a special Demonica Suit.」
PRINTW 「You'll die if you can't endure that environment.」
PRINTW 「Thus, a Demonica Suit is necessary to search the Schwarzwelt.」
PRINTW 「But demonica suits are very expensive, so the organization can't afford to give one to just any member.」
PRINTL 「However, they recently developed an app to put on the ＣＯＭＰ.」
PRINTW 「Improving the Harmonizer system, they developed a new software: Demonica.」
PRINTL 「When you install this on your ＣＯＭＰ, it will regulate the environment in your vicinity.」
PRINTW 「Shifting it into one humans can survive in.」
PRINTW 「Additionally, Demonica has the ability to reduce the size of other software when installed.」
PRINTW 「I don't know which ones are compressed by it, but I think that is very convenient.」
PRINTW 「Use it carefully.」
PRINTL
CALL MESSAGE_B(1, CALLNAME:MASTER + " obtained the COMP software「Demonica」")
