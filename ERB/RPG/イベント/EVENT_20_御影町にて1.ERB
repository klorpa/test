	PRINTL You went to explore Mikage-Cho, now that you can enter.
	PRINTL There are no people on the streets, not even dead people, looking like they could run and hide surprisingly well.
	PRINTL There are demons, but none are particularly powerful.
	PRINTFORML There seem to be many places where pockets of space have been sent to a different world, but when they are avoided, %CALLNAME:MASTER% faces no particular danger.
	PRINTL ......
	PRINTL ....
	PRINTW ...
	PRINTL For a while you just walk arround, but then you heard a disturbance nearby.
	PRINTL While hiding in the shadow of the buildings, you moved to investigate.
	PRINTL You saw a girl with freckles, who was chased by three men in black.
	PRINTL The uniform she is wearing is that of the St. Hermelin High School of Mikage-Cho.
	PRINTL She doesn't seem to be an ordinary human, as she is fighting back using magic, 
	PRINTL but since it's 3v1, it's only a matter of time until she is overwhelmed.

		PRINTL The 3 men in black fell.
		PRINTL It seems they weren't ordinary people...
		PRINTL 「Oh, you helped me out...you, what...?」
		PRINTL The girl is still on guard and somewhat suspicous of you.
		CALL INPUT_YN("Let's talk", "Leave her")
		IF RESULT == 0
			PRINTFORML ...%CALLNAME:MASTER% calmed the girl and convinced her to have a conversation.
			PRINTL She introduced herself as 「Yuka Ayase」. She is a persona-user and a student of St. Hermelin High School.
			PRINTL When she went outside into Mikage-Cho, she saw those black guys doing something in the abandoned factory, and they began to chase her.
			PRINTL By the way, how should you explain yourself?
			PRINTL Since the barrier can only be pierced for a short amount to time, only a few people can enter and exit.
			PRINTL Although this girl is alone, it is evident she'd want to help out everybody...
			CALL INPUT_YN("Try to deceive her", "Speak at length to pursuade her")

				CALL INCREASE_LC, -4
				PRINTL Unfortunately, Ayase doesn't appear to be entirely convinced.
				PRINTL She regards you with suspicous eyes, then makes a hasty retreat...
				CALL INPUT_YN("Leave", "Catch and enslave her")
				IF RESULT == 0
					PRINTL No need to get further involved.
					PRINTL With the girl's power, she should be able to avoid danger and reach a safe place.

					PRINTL Chased Ayase and easily caught her by the back of her clothes.
					PRINTL Giving her no time to complain, you hit her neck.
					PRINTL The girl collapsed like a doll whose strings were cut.
					PRINTW Yuka Ayase became a slave.

				ENDIF
			ELSE
				CALL INCREASE_LD, 4
				PRINTL Talked at length to try and pursuade her.
				PRINTL When the talk was over, Ayase's eyes softened a bit.
				PRINTL 「Well, I don't quite understand but...you are going something about the situation in this town, right?」
				PRINTL 「That there would be someone like that, that's good to hear. Would it be fine if I told everybody?」
				PRINTL Parted with Ayase as she left to return to her school.
				イベントフラグ:20:0 = 5
			ENDIF
			PRINTL Afterwards, you examined the fallen men in black.
			PRINTL Their leader has some kind of ID card, maybe it could be useful?
			PRINTW Decided to pocket it.

			PRINTL No need to get further involved.

		PRINTL Soon, the girl could no longer resist and fell.
		PRINTL 『She gave us a hard time....should we kill her?』
		PRINTL 『....I'll ask the higher-ups for orders. Let's head back.』
		PRINTL The 3 left with the girl.
		PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER%, while hiding, watched the men enter a brand-new building.
