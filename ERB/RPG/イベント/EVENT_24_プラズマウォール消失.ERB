PRINTW A message came from the Phantom Society.
PRINTW The mysterious wall that covered Mikage-cho has disappeared.
PRINTW While the cause is unknown, the incident seems to be settled.
PRINTW Since it was not resolved by a summoner of the Phantom Society, there is a follow-up request to investigate. 
PRINTW However, it would take much time and effort and the payment is bad.
PRINTW No need to bother with that...
PRINTW -Megami Ibunroku Persona route disappeared-
