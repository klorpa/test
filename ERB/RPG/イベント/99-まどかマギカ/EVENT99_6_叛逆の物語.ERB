	PRINTFORMW After defeating the mighty witch Walpurgisnacht, %NAME:MASTER% took a break at the safe house.
	PRINTFORMW However, the break was disturbed by an Incubator.
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「Greetings, it has been a while, 『%NAME:MASTER%』.」
	PRINTW 「It's not a great thing, but I have a job for you.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW Why did an Incubator, who does not exist in this world, come to offer a job?
	PRINTW 「As I believe Homura has informed you, we Incubators have split into factions.」
	PRINTW 「I am here on behalf of the faction that found no problems with the current system.」
	PRINTW 「I met you before with Homura Akemi, but you humans have not been able to distinguish between our terminals.」
	PRINTW 「So I introduced myself again.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTFORMW That was easy to understand, but what does this Incubator want of %NAME:MASTER%?
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「After we returned to our world with Homura, we still had to destroy many demons.」
	PRINTW 「As, the flow of time in our worlds are different. Did you think that not much time has passed since you faced Walpurgisnacht?」
	PRINTW 「At any rate, Homura has continued to face the demons for a long time.」
	PRINTW 「However, she is not invincible. The time where she would use up her power and be claimed by the Law of Cycles has come at last.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW It sounds like a problem has come up with her.
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「A good decuction. That must be from the experience of a career warrior.」
	PRINTW 「I explained earlier that there was a faction that was attempting to return to the previous system of witches.」
	PRINTW 「For now, I shall call that faction radicals.」
	PRINTW 「The radicals have trapped Akemi's soul gem in an isolation field, to analyze the Law of Cycles.」
	PRINTW 「This field is strong enough to prevent interference by the Law of Cycles, allowing Homura's soul gem to turn into a grief seed.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW That sounds like the request is to capture or destroy Homura's witch.
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「No, this situation is unfavorable for our faction.」
	PRINTW 「Homura is turning into a witch, but cannot spread her barrier outside of the field, due to the field's disruption.」
	PRINTW 「Thus, the barrier is entirely contained within her soul gem and has attracted people needed for her『daily routine』.」
	PRINTW 「The radicals have adjusted the field accordingly. The field only allows entry not escape.」
	PRINTW 「As a result, many people, including the Law of Cycles, were caught in Homura's barrier.」
	PRINTW 「And in the barrier, Homura has rewritten their memories as convenient. Perhaps including the Law of Cycles, Madoka Kaname.」
	PRINTW 「All to match Homura's idea of『everyday life』. This balance is extremely delicate.」
	PRINTW 「Thus, it will not last long. Should the Law of Cycles awaken, it will attempt to retrieve Homura.」
	PRINTW 「At that time, the radicals will be able to completely analyze the Law of Cycles. With that information, they would be able to interfere with the Law of Cycles.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW If they manage to develop a method to destroy that Law of Cycles, the magical girls of the world will again turn into witches.	
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「That is the situation. Although that may be ideal for energy efficiency, it's too risky to rewrite the universe for that.」
	PRINTW 「There are two ways to prevent this.」
	PRINTW 「The first is to kill Homura in her barrier. As her barrier cannot leave her soul gem, she can「still」be called a magical girl.」
	PRINTW 「If a magical girl's soul gem is not filled, the Law of Cycles will not appear. So if you kill Homura now, she will not be retrieved.」
	PRINTW 「Alternatively, you may abduct Homura. If she disappeared from inside her soul gem, the Law of Cycles will not be observed.」
	PRINTW 「In the soul gem, she stays as human as possible. For you, would she not make a good acquisition?」
	PRINTW 「As she would be without her soul gem, she would not transform into a witch.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW ...However, it would be hard to kidnap or kill one who fought as your partner in the past.
	PRINTW Beyond that, her time stop would make her a powerful opponent.
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「There is another method. You could attempt to destroy all the radical's terminals and the isolation field.」
	PRINTW 「However, there is a problem with that. As the radicals are heavily monitoring the field, we cannot send you there.」
	PRINTW 「Therefore, the fact that Homura's soul gem barrier can be entered from outside will be the key.」
	PRINTW 「Break into the soul gem and destroy the isolation field from inside and annihilate the radical group.」
	PRINTW 「Although this method would also be exteremly difficult, you can break through the field as long as you awaken the Law of Cycles.」
	PRINTW 「Kill Homura or awaken the Law of Cycles and destroy the radical group before Homura is taken.」
	PRINTW 「That is our request.」
	PRINTW 「We expect you, who defeated even Walpurgisnacht, to succeed.」
	PRINTW 「Naturally, we have a method to send you into the soul gem and to extract you in case of that world's collapse.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW In the COMP, a new terminal was registered...
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「That is the terminal we made. We secretly installed it in Homura's soul gem.」
	PRINTW 「We offer plenty rewards if you stake your life on this.」
	PRINTW 「This is all the information we have for you. The radicals have the place well guarded, preventing us from gathering much information.」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW ...If the Incubator claims to have no more information, they have no more information.
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「Now, join us and protect the universe!」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW This reeks of a setup, but Homura has confirmed their inability to lie.
	PRINTW No matter which solution is chosen, there is profit to be had from completing this contract...
