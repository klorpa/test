	PRINTFORML ―%CALLNAME:MASTER%'s safe house―
	PRINTFORMW %CALLNAME:MASTER% awoke, feeling something was off。
	PRINTL 

	PRINTFORMW There was someone else here。
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW In this highly-secured room, someone entered completely unnoticed。
	PRINTFORMW Jumping in front of %CALLNAME:MASTER%…
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW ――was a small red-eyed animal. It was Kyubey。
	PRINTFORMW 「I've entered. I have something to speak with you about」
	PRINTFORMW The intruder began to speak boldly。
	PRINTFORMW 「Did you see that at the commercial district？」
	PRINTFORMW 「When a magical girl――turned into a witch。」
	PRINTFORMW 「I came by to explain that and to discuss business。」
	PRINTFORMW Kyubey's expression did not change…
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「Do you know about entropy？」
	PRINTFORMW 「Simply put, some energy is lost every time it is transformed。」
	PRINTFORMW 「The energy in the universe as a whole is decreasing」
	PRINTFORMW 「So to save the universe, we sought an energy that is not bound by the laws of thermodynamics――」
	PRINTFORMW 「――We created『Magical Girls』to gather energy from emotions and souls during the transition of hope to despair。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「Oh, do not worry. The magical girls that serve you won't become witches。」
	PRINTW 「Apparently, magical girls contracted with the summoning program do not become witches。」
	PRINTW 「We have not elucidated why, but that is probably enough for you。」
	PRINTW 「In the first place, you also gave the data to『Phantom Society』…」
	PRINTW 「This caused『The fact that magical girls exist』to be in this world。」
	PRINTW 「Because a magical girl of salvation cannot exist in a world where there are no magical girls。」
	PRINTL
	PRINTFORMW After saying that, Kyubey turned to %CALLNAME:MASTER% and said more。
	PRINTFORMW 「When I came to this world, I was surprised to find that a similar emotional energy utilization technology existed in the form of『magnetite』。」
	PRINTFORMW 「Just like how we collect emotional energy to extend the life of the universe…」
	PRINTFORMW 「There is an organization called Phantom Society that collects magnetite for some purpose。」
	PRINTFORMW 「In conclusion, those of Phantom Society seem to have different values then even those of your own species。」
	PRINTFORMW 「Cooperating with『demons』that should have different values, to gather the souls of humans who are the same race。」
	PRINTFORMW 「――Then, couldn't you have an efficient cooperative relationship with us『Incubators』too？」
	PRINTW
	PRINTFORMW 「In the world I came from, we have an efficient emotional energy recovery system starting with wishes and ending in curses。」
	PRINTFORMW 「But when a magical girl rewrote the laws of the universe, the system collapsed。」
	PRINTFORMW 「Magical Girl Madoka Kaname made a wish that broke causality。」
	PRINTFORMW 「What I want to do is to repair that efficient system。」
	PRINTFORMW 「…The purity of Madoka Kaname。」
	PRINTFORMW 「If you can drag her down from a concept――we can eliminate her。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「For this, we offer technology to gather emotional energy more efficiently。」
	PRINTFORMW 「From you, the strength to overthrow Madoka Kaname…the flexibility of a devil summoner。」
	PRINTFORMW 「If you succeed in defeating Madoka Kaname, a provision of magnetite will be sent from our world。」
	PRINTFORMW 「And you can make an extravagant wish to be an almighty being without risking ruin」
	PRINTL 「Now, to business――」
	PRINTL
	PRINTFORMW 「Don't listen to him. He does not share human values。」
	PRINTL
	PRINTL Suddenly, a voice echoed throughout the room一。
	PRINTFORMW ――a beautiful girl with long black hair was standing there。
	PRINTFORMW 「Have we met at the commercial district？」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I am Homura Akemi, a time traveler. I use magic to cross time and space…」
	PRINTFORMW 「I did not think I could come to this world without the help of the devil summoning program. Was this time manipulation？」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「I will continue fighting. For the world that girl tried to protect。」
	PRINTFORMW 「I will never let you do as you please。Incubator。」
	PRINTFORMW 「And in the human world, weapons aren't brought to negotiations。」
	PRINTFORMW 「Do you want to bring『Walpurgisnacht』 here?」
	PRINTFORMW 「With no need to hide in a barrier for protection, yet invisible to normal people, the most powerful witch。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「One of the forces prepared to defeat Madoka Kaname. An if this deal breaks down…」
	PRINTFORMW 「Something to bring to this world to destroy the evidence。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTFORMW 「…Do you understand Devil Summoner? No deals can be made with these things that do not understand human values。」
	PRINTFORMW 「Though I am no longer human, I can still make a deal with you。」
	PRINTFORMW 「I do have things to offer. I can offer information on『Walpurgisnacht』and the power of a magical girl。」
	PRINTFORMW 「If they lose『Walpurgisnacht』, the Incubator will no longer be able to interfere in this world。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTL 「Work with us and become almighty！」
	PRINTW 「Please work with me and crush the Incubators' plans。」

		PRINTFORMW 「…That is your choice. We share the same fate now。」
		PRINTFORMW Homura Akemi gave a satisfied smile at %CALLNAME:MASTER%'s choice。
		PRINTFORMW 「You humans are hard to understand as expected。」
		PRINTFORMW 「Why is the life or death of an individual so important? Just what will you sacrifice?」
		PRINTL （boom）
		PRINTFORMW Suddenly, a hole was blown in the Incubator's face！
		PRINTFORMW 「No more from you. There is nowhere else for you to turn, miracle seller。」
		PRINTFORMW Holding a smoking gun, Homura spoke。
		PRINTFORMW Due to the sudden gunshot, the safehouse began to grow noisy。
		PRINTFORMW 「…A strategy meeting cannot be held now。」
		PRINTFORMW 「I will definitely return. You will not lose to the Incubator.」
		PRINTFORMW 「I will continue fighting. I will defeat all foes. For the world that girl tried to protect。」
		PRINTFORMW Homura Akemi vanished in an instant。
		PRINTL 
		PRINTFORMW The catastrophic witch, Walpurgisnacht。
		PRINTFORMW Even with the help of a magical girl, can it be beaten…？

		PRINTFORMW 「No way! Are you aware of the kind to being you'll be helping！？」
		PRINTFORMW Hearing %CALLNAME:MASTER%'s choice enraged Homura。
		PRINTFORMW 「That reaction is unreasonable. \@IS_MALE(MASTER) ? He#She\@ will work with us, regardless of our diferences。」
		PRINTFORMW 「You are the last one who should say that。」
		PRINTL （boom）
		PRINTFORMW Suddenly, a hole was blown in the Incubator's face！
		PRINTFORMW 「Enough. I have many more. I still cannot depend on anyone. There is no need for anyone to understand。」
		PRINTFORMW Holding a smoking gun, Homura spoke。
		PRINTFORMW From the sudden gunshot, the safehouse began to grow noisy。
		PRINTFORMW 「…It seems I can't kill you here。」
		PRINTFORMW 「I will continue fighting. I will kill all enemies. For the world that girl wanted to protect。」
		PRINTFORMW Homura Akemi instantly vanished。
		PRINTL 
		PRINTFORMW 「…Although you know it is wasteful. You don't learn, Homura Akemi。」
		PRINTFORMW Next to the body of the Incubator, ther was another Incubator。
		PRINTFORMW 「We gave the 『key』to the『Devil Summoning Program』of this world。」
		PRINTFORMW 「Now that the two are complete, Madoka Kaname can prepare to fix these distorted conditions. Although some adjustment will be necessary…」
		PRINTFORMW 「Draggin down a god, reverting her to a magical girl and defeating her. This cannot be stopped by just Homura Akemi。」
		PRINTFORMW The Incubator's expression was still unchanged。
