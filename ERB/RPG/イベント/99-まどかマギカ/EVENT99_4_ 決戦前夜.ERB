	PRINTW 「Do you understand? Your opponent is a magical girl so strong as to be able to rewrite reality。」
	PRINTW 「This is not an opponent you can afford to underestimate。」
	PRINTW 「Today, I came here to inform and advise you。」
	PRINTW 「Kaname Madoka――the countermeasures against a magical girl equal to God have been completed。」
	PRINTW 「Have you fused a witch？」

		PRINTW 「While having it equipped, use the software titled『Incubator』。」
		PRINTW 「Then you can make a witch by fusing a demon of the appropriate race to a Zoma。」
		PRINTW 「If you have not done this, how about coming back once you have made a witch?」
	ELSE
		PRINTW 「Is that so? That is good。」
	ENDIF
	PRINTW 「Anyways, the presence of a witch is an important advantage against Madoka Kaname。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「Our world collects emotional energy gathered in the form of wraiths。」
	PRINTW 「Magical girls fight the wraiths and we recover the energy little by little. This is a sustainable but inefficient strategy。」
	PRINTL 「However, in the past, a terminal had by chance managed to observe the modification of the universe and send the data。」
	PRINTW 「Modifications to the universe are normally unobservable, because there is no proof of them in the rewritten world。」
	PRINTW 「Perhaps because there were originally no magical girls in this world, it has managed to escape the influence of Madoka's modification。」
	PRINTW 「And we were split into two factions. A troubling problem。」
	PRINTW 「Whether to continue our current sustained harvesting, or to return to the previous system by eliminating Madoka。」
	PRINTW 「I am a terminal of the side that judged the previous system to be more efficient。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「Even diminished, Madoka Kaname is still mighty. She might not be defeatable in a direct conflict。」
	PRINTW 「But there is still a way。」
	PRINTW 「A『witch』 called by your『demon summoning program』is and object as well as information。」
	PRINTW 「If we perform signal interference using that witch, you will be able to send normal attacks through the weakened barrier。」
	PRINTW 「Just bring a witch to the final battle. Then we can weaken the barrier.」
	PRINTW 「I will be leaving now. I do not need to spend any more time here.」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW The Incubator then disappeared。
	PRINTW 『Bring a witch to the final battle』to『prepare to face her overwhelming might』
	PRINTW In order to fight against the magaical girl that became a concept, preparations were needed…

	CALL INPUT_YN, "Yes", "No"

	PRINTL
	PRINTW As Homura spoke, something came from the shadows。
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「In comprehensible after all. You should use the tools you have available。」
	PRINTL
	PRINTW The emotionless Incubator entered the scene。
	PRINTL
	PRINTW 「…I will provide introduction. This is an Incubator. This one is from another faction than the one you met earlier。」
	PRINTW 「After witches were born in our world, the curses of the world appeared in the form of wraiths。」
	PRINTW 「Magical girls fight them and Kyubey collects the energy little by little. It is a new system。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「Ordinarily, it is not possible to observe the modification of the universe, because there is no proof of it in the rewritten world。」
	PRINTW 「I was amazed to learn that a terminal was able to witness the rare occasion。」
	PRINTW 「Perhaps because there were originally no magical girls in this world, it was able to escape the influence of Madoka's modification。」
	PRINTW 「And we divided into two factions. A troubling problem。」
	PRINTW 「Whether to use sustainable harvesting of wraiths or to use the large sums of witches。」
	PRINTW 「I am a terminal from the faction that believes that there is no problem with the current system。」
	PRINTW 「My faction sent Homura Akemi to this universe to stop the opposing faction's attempt to rewrite the universe again。」
	PRINTW 「Because she has time magic, she is the only girl that remembers the world before it was modified. Such a convenient existence。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「It is absurd to say that you have no feelings, yet split up into factions.…Such are our circumstances。」
	PRINTW 「We had a reason for coming here. We came here to give information on Walpurgisnacht。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「I'll explain。」
	PRINTW 「Walpurgisnacht is a mighty witch. It is not a being that can be beaten in a direct conflict。」
	PRINTW 「But there is still a way。」
	PRINTW 「The『Magical girls』you call with the『demon summoning program』 are both objects and information。」
	PRINTW 「If we interfere using the information of the magical girl, we will be able to weaken witches。」
	PRINTW 「You only need to bring the magical girl to the final battle. Then, we can weaken the barrier。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW 「…These are the best countermeasures we can take. Please make use of this information, devil summoner。」
	PRINTW 「We must also prepare. I will leave now。」
	PRINTL 
	PRINTW Homura left。
	PRINTW 『Bring a magical girl to the final battle』to『counter that overwhelming power』
	PRINTW Anyways, you must prepare to battle against a city-destroying witch…
