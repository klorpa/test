## Game Information

### Project Status
Currently in the process of overhauling the translation/game. See [This Branch](https://gitgud.io/eragames/eraMegaten/tree/contributors/spaghetti-code) for the overhaul. It will be merged into the master branch at regular intervals.

### Game Description
An odd mish-mash of various mechanics and features of different Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei games, all the way up to Persona 4. Make your character, set your sexual preferences, choose your starting slave and get to exploring dungeons. Fight and negotiate with demons, train them and human party members along one of three paths, affection, lasciviousness, or submission, to sell, keep, or put to work, or combine them to make stronger demons. You are given a wide range of plot lines to follow to resolution taken from a wide variety of Megaten games, or become a famous slave trainer and achieve fame and riches in your own right.  

### Game Wiki
Coming soon.
